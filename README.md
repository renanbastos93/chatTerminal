# chatTerminal
 Chat via terminal with nodejs

### /nickname
  With the /nickname it can set your nickname
  
### /clear

## Future Implementations
  1. /private
  2. /close
  3. /createRoom
  4. /closeRoom
  
## Note
  I also want to manipulate the processes / cluster worker to handle the chat , because the node is single- thred . This project is the study of vision, and if someone needs to use at some point .
